Description: QUISK is a Software Defined Radio (SDR).  
        You supply a complex (I/Q) mixer to convert radio spectrum to an
        intermediate frequency (IF) and send that IF to the left and right
        inputs of the sound card in your computer.  The QUISK software will
        read the sound card data, tune it, filter it, demodulate it, and send
        the audio to the same sound card for output to external headphones or
        speakers.
        
        Quisk can also control and demodulate data from the SDR-IQ from RfSpace.
        
        Quisk works with the quisk_lppan_k3 package by Leigh, WA5ZNU, to
        control the N8LP LP-PAN panadapter and the Elecraft K3.
