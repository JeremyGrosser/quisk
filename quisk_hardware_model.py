# Please do not change this hardware control module for Quisk.
# It is a basic module providing almost no features.  You should
# still use it a a base class for your own hardware modules.

# If you want to use a hardware module different from the default
# module quisk_hardware_model, then specify it in your quisk_conf.py:
#     import quisk_hardware_myhardware as quisk_hardware
# or if it is in the n2adr (or other) package:
#     from n2adr import quisk_hardware

# A custom hardware module should subclass this module; start it with:
#    from quisk_hardware_model import Hardware as BaseHardware
#    class Hardware(BaseHardware):
#      def __init__(self, app, conf):
#        BaseHardware.__init__(self, app, conf)
#          ###   your module starts here

# Alternatively, you can define a class named "Hardware" in your config file,
# and that class will be used instead of a hardware file.  This is recommended
# only for simple hardware needs.  The class should start the same as above.

class Hardware:

    # frequency in the center of the display; that is, the RF frequency corresponding to an
    # audio frequency of zero Hertz.  The tuning frequency is the RF frequency indicated by
    # the tuning line on the display, and is equivalent to the transmit frequency.  The quisk
    # receive frequency is the tuning frequency plus the RIT (receive incremental tuning).
    # If your hardware will not change to the requested frequencies, return different
    # frequencies.
    # The source is a string indicating the source of the change:
    #   BtnBand       A band button
    #   BtnUpDown     The band Up/Down buttons
    #   FreqEntry     The user entered a frequency in the box
    #   MouseBtn1     Left mouse button press
    #   MouseBtn3     Right mouse button press
    #   MouseMotion   The user is dragging with the left button
    #   MouseWheel    The mouse wheel up/down
    #   NewDecim      The decimation changed
    # For "BtnBand", the string band is in the band argument.
    # For the mouse events, the handler event is in the event argument.

    #        any reason, self.application.vardecim_set is None.
